## üöÄ Getting Started / Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Poetry
- Docker and Docker Compose (for PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JuniorSeniorSupport.git
    cd JuniorSeniorSupport
    ```

2.  **Create and configure the `.env` file:**
    Copy the example environment file and fill in your details.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *You will need to provide your database credentials, a secret key, and an OpenAI token.*

3.  **Launch services with Docker:**
    This command will start the PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ containers.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Install project dependencies:**
    Poetry will create a virtual environment and install all required packages.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

5.  **Apply the database migrations:**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    poetry run alembic upgrade head
    ```

6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```

7.  **Run the Celery worker (in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    poetry run celery -A src.mailing.tasks worker -l INFO
    ```

The application is now available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and the interactive API documentation is at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
